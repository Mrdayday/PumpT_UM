## What is this component for?
Its part of the FermenTUM project. This is a pump system is used to feed the reactor during fermentation. It can be used for linear feeding.

## About us and the project
We are a group of students from the Technical University of Munich. In the context of a module at our university the following project was created. It is a part of the FermenTUM project. The aim is to build a low-budget bioreactor for use in an internship. The students should learn the basic functions of this machine via a very simple construction. The main difficulty is the size of the container used. It is a [GLS 80Â® by Schott/Duran](https://www.duran-group.com/uploads/tx_fedownloads/GLS80_A5_E_01.pdf).

## How to use the informations in this Git
For programming the Arduino IDE was used if it is not installed on your device jet you can get it [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). The [software](https://github.com/Mrdayday/PumpT_UM/tree/master/Software) is in the folder of the same name. Just upload it to the Arduino that you want to use.(We used an [Arduino Nano](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoNano))
The wiring and soldering can be seen in [here](https://github.com/Mrdayday/PumpT_UM/blob/master/Wiring.md).

There are also data sheets of the used parts.
